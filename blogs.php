            <p>Leftover food is something no restaurant can avoid. It accumulates at the end of the working day and is often just thrown away at night. This food waste will go straight to landfill instead of donating those hungry poor people across the country. That’s the reason Arsalan restaurant has started to donate leftover foods to NGOs. They have donated around 5 million of food throughout the year. This helped more than 50 thousand poor hungry people in India.</p>
            <p>Arsalan is one of the best place to have Biriyani in Kolkata. Except biriyani, other dishes were very average. This place is always crowded and parking is a big problem since they have very limited space. Arsalan is said to be one of the best in Kolkata. You could try the other branch near the AJC Bose Road overbridge. It is a small joint but better service and ambience.</p>

            <p>The willingness to help and make a difference is all that one needs. There is nothing more to it; everything else will fall into place. Sometimes the staff does not even want to eat that food since they are tired of eating it so often. They cannot store them and use it again because it wouldn’t be fresh, so instead of wasting it, we are glad we found a way to feed the hungry. Zeeshan restaurant has known to be donated 3 million foods till now.</p>
            <p>Zeeshan Restaurant at Park Circus makes sure one has a great food experience by offering highly palatable food. The various services offered at the venue include Air Conditioned, Home Delivery, and Take Away Only. Price for Two approx Rs. 400. The restaurant welcomes guests’ diners to relish a scrumptious meal with wide range of the food. Zeeshan is a good place for the students for having Mughlai Food. Their Biriyani and kebab are very tasty. Rolls are tasty and very pocket friendly. It is very close to the park circus 7 point crossing. It's a great place for family. Quality and quantity both are good. Kabab platter is great. Value for money.</p>
